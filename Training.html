			<h1>Training</h1>
			
			<h2>An Overview of our Training</h2>
			
			<p>At Family Fun Play Camp (FFPC), we run a variety of programs for the whole family, starting from kinds ages 4 - 14, and adults of all ages throughout the year. 
			Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we have had to cancel or delay many of our regular programs. </p>
			
			<p>Below is a description of the different types of training and programs that we typically offer at FFPC:</p>
			
			<h3>Spring Training (April - June)</h3>
			
			<p>Spring Training is a weekend tennis clinic that focuses on fundamental skills and high quality repetitions to get players ready for the beginning of 
			their season. Our tennis instructors review the proper mechanics of swinging and provide the players with ample opportunity to practice each 
			skill through a series of high-energy drills. In addition, various team concepts are introduced including exhibition plays and advanced practice.</p>
			
			<h3>Summer Camps (July & August)</h3>

			<p>FFPC’s summer camps focus on providing a safe and inclusive environment in which young athletes and performers can learn, practice and compete. 
			We offer full day summer camps (Monday - Friday) for boys and girls ages 4-14. Since launching our first camp as North Toronto Baseball Camp in 2007, 
			our camps have grown to over 2,000 annual campers and have expanded to include basketball, football, soccer and multi-sport camps in Toronto 
			and Etobicoke. Different training locations will be planned through out the year which will be provided to the students upon enrollment.</p>

			<p>FFPC’s Multi-Sport March Break Camp is a recreational day camp for girls and boys ages 4 to 12 years old of all skill levels! Our goal is 
			to expose campers to a wide variety of sports in order to develop fundamental movement and sport skills with an emphasis on fun, fair play 
			and teamwork. We offer various sports and activities including cooperative, territory and target games as well!</p> 
			
			<p>This camp has historically taken place at Branksome Hall located just north of Mt. Pleasant and Bloor.,</p>

			<h3>After School and Weekend Clinics (September - June)</h3>

			<p>We offer a variety of 60 or 90 minute indoor and outdoor tennis and soccer skill-development clinics. 
			Our clinics are weekly programs that focus on fundamental skills and will provide players of all skill levels with a 
			fun and energy-filled activity after school or on the weekend. These programs have historically been offered for boys 
			and girls ages 4 - 13 together with your accompanying parents (if they wish to join) in mid-town Toronto.</p>

			<h3>Instructional Leagues (September - October & May - June)</h3>

			<p>Our outdoor T-ball and Baseball instructional leagues give players the opportunity to be a part of a team while still developing 
			their baseball skills! Each week our outstanding coaches spend approximately 20 - 30 minutes on skill-development drills, with the 
			rest of the time spent on game-play.</p>

			<h3>Tennis and Soccer League (October - April)</h3>

			<p>Our indoor tennis and soccer leagues are an instructional house league where players will have the opportunity to learn the game of 
			tennis and soccer in a fun and pressure-free environment. The program includes: a combine day, regular season and tournament day.</p> 
			
			<p>The said sports has many benefits when it comes to the development of each individual player. In past years, these leagues 
			have been offered at Leo Baeck Day School (Bathurst & Eglinton).</p>
